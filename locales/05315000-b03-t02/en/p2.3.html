    Probably from the 3rd Century, the pillar remains of the Roman water pipe in Berrenrather Straße (in front of house no. 436). The original location was on the opposite side of the road. Via this younger water pipe, drinking water was led over a distance of 77.6 km from the area of Nettersheim in the Hocheifel to the Roman Cologne. This water pipe is considered one of the greatest achievements of Roman engineering in Germany.
