<p>
    The Klettenbergpark, designed in 1905/06 according to the design of garden director Fritz Encke, was built instead of a sand and gravel pit up to 10 m deep. The remodelling of this pit resulted from a simultaneous construction project of a construction company to open up the environment with a country house development. In the park, in the middle of which a pond fed by the Duffesbach was created, the walker should be able to get to know various Rhenish landscape sections in the form of a sequence of corresponding vegetation images (forest, meadow and shore parts) as well as typical rock formations (basalt and shale quarry) and observe their seasonal changes.
