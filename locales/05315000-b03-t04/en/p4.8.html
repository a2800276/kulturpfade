    1929-1935, according to the plans of the head of the Cologne Building Office, Adolf Abel, the new building of the university, which until then was housed in the Cologne Südstadt, took place. The strictly axially aligned building structure with a dominant central portal and six rear wings is characterised by a classicist basic attitude, which stands in contrast to the modernity of the "new building" (Bauhaus). Stylistically, the building can be assigned to the conservatively oriented "Stuttgart School", whose representative was Adolf Abel in addition to Paul Bonatz and Paul Schmitthenner, among others.
