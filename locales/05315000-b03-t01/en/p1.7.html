    Due to the strong expansion of Weiden, which was supervised by Lövenich, the construction of a first parish church had become necessary in 1927. The design for this church was provided by the architects Böll & Neuhaus. Stylistically, the church is one of the few sacred examples of expressionist architecture in Cologne.
