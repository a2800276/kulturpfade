<p> In 1927, construction of the first parish church in Weiden became necessary
due to the rapid expansion of the town, which was ecclesiastically served by
Lövenich. The design for this church was provided by the architects Böll &amp;
Neuhaus. Stylistically, the church is one of the few examples of Expressionist
chruch architecture in Cologne. </p>
