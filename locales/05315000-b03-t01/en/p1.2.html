<p> The Cologne patrician family Scherffgen was one of the wealthiest and
influential families in the 16th and 17th. Century Cologne. They traded goods
such as wine, cereals and spices and were also active bankers. The Scherffgens
were members of the <i>KÃ¶lner Rat</i>(city council) and held various offices,
including that of  mayor. The family owned several magnificent city palaces and
became known for its generous endowments and charitable work. One well-known
family member was 18th century Johann Peter Scherffgen, who was active as a
lawyer and author. Today, a street in Cologne still commemorates the once
influential family. </p>
