<p> The old village church lies on a slight hill in the center of Junkersdorf
surrounded by the village cemetary. today the building serves as a
Kindergarten. The church was first documented in 1223, but it is assumed that a
church already existed here in 898. In 1324, the church was incorporated into
the Cologne <i>Gereonsstift</i> (Gereon Monastary) . In 1676, a fire caused
extensive damage to the interior. A further fire in 1754 left only the church's
choir standing. During reconstruction, the west tower was added to the church.
In the middle of the 19th century, the church was extended into a basilica.</p>
