    An inscription above the gate says that the court in 1768 by the Commander MHE. Detils has been restored. Legendary traditions know the property as a Lehenshof of the Brauweiler Abbey. Possible, but not confirmed by documents, is that the Cologne Johanniter-Komturei was the owner of the farm until secularisation. The extremely stately closed complex of the Odemshof is one of the large courtyards of LÃ¶venich. Unique for Cologne is the broadly mounted late Baroque mansion with its curly gables. In front of the courtyard entrance there is a crossroads from 1862, which commemorates the former tenants Krosch-Lemper.
