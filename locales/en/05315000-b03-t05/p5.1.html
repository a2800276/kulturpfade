<p>The Aachen pond was created in 1923/24 according to the design of the Hamburg urban architect Fritz Schumacher with the participation of the unemployed from Cologne. Originally, a framing of the pond with monumental public representation buildings was planned. In 1968/69 the Japanese Cultural Institute (architect: Ã”hashi) was created here and in 1974-77 the Museum of East Asian Art (architect: Kunio Mayekawa), both buildings by Japanese architects. The Japanese garden landscape integrated into the museum wing is subordinated to the strict symmetrical design of the Aachener Weiher.</p>
