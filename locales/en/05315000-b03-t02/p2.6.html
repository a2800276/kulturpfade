    Fort VI was built in the course of creating an outer fortress belt around the city of Cologne in 1873-76. After the grinding of the fortifications in accordance with the demands of the Versailles Treaty, only the city-side larynx barracks and parts of the lateral flank trenches remained of the large fortification. When the fortress site was included in the park landscape of the Outer Green Belt, 1923-27, the ground floor of the throat barracks in the ditch disappeared by raising the ground level to the upper floor. In the recreation facility created according to the design of Fritz Encke, a rock garden was created in the northern side ditch. The route guidance and terrain formation derived Encke from the ground structure of the fort. 1980-82 the fort received superstructures.
